# Readme

Start by creating a clean python environment. I use pyenv:

    pyenv virtualenv 3.9.4 docker-compose-fastapi-react-nginx-3.9.4
    pyenv activate docker-compose-fastapi-react-nginx-3.9.4

We need docker-compose installed so install the requirements from the base directory:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

This is just to run docker. The other dependencies are contained in their respective directories.
